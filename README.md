My code for the Assignments

The producer seems to working in order, however the consumer isn't consumming anything. It may be due to the fact is it waiting constantly or simply the output isn't being printed out correctly. 

I put the main and producer and consumer all in one cpp and it does what it supposed to do two produce and two consume. Maybe when it is put into two executables is where the issue arises
